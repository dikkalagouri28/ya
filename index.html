              Hello Everyone!!!
              I am XYZ currently pursuing BTech final year from Raghu Engineering College.
              I am actually good at Academics aa well as other technical activities like Hacker rank,code chef etc other
              than regular
              subjects. I actually completed an internship on AI using Python where I have done 2 projects regarding
              predictions using logistic regression and naive
              bias regression. I completed some of the internships on AICTE which includes robotics, cloud computing,
              AI-ML.
              I am an enthusiastic learner towards development. I like to explore new technologies and learn them.
              I am good at some programming languages. I am looking forward for full stack development.I am already
              learning Front End from various
              sources and learning it. <br>


              Technologies used : HTML, CSS, Bootstrap,JS
              <br>

              Utilized various HTML elements and CSS3 techniques to build a portfolio
              <br>
              <br>

              As a Fresher I expect to get into a Good product based company. I am very good at programming and I have
              participated in
              many coding contests. I have also completed many courses in Udemy and Great Learning. I attended many
              seminars of various fields like
              cyber security,robotics. I am also developing a website which helps the user to know about my college and
              I am still working on
              it. At present I have some foundation on web development and I am trying to improve my skills on web
              development.Through my educational
              journey I have gained some valuable knowledge taught from my school and college. I have a very good time
              management skills which make
              me responsible and complete the task or work on time.
              <br>

              <h7> Projects</h7>
              <br>
              Project 1 :
              <br>
              Project idea –
              The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous wrecks in history. On April 15, 1912,
              during her maiden voyage, the RMS Titanic, widely considered “unsinkable”, sank after
              hitting an iceberg. Unfortunately, there were not enough lifeboats for everyone on board,
              resulting in the deaths of 1,502 out of 2,224 passengers and crew. While there was an
              element of luck in survival, it appears that certain groups of people were more likely to
              survive than others.
              You have to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck based on data such as
              their age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. For example, it is highly probable that someone
              rich from the first-class survived as compared to someone from the third class. You can use
              the Titanic dataset on Kaggle for this project. And just to make things more interesting, this
              dataset contains real data based on the people who died and survived the actual Titanic
              disaster.Use a classification technique ( Logistic regression, SVM OR Naïve Bayes) to predict
              whether a passenger will survive based on the characteristics of the data.
              <br>
              DATASET reference : https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data?select=train.csv
              <br>
              <br>
              Project 2 :<br>
              Project idea – The dataset has house prices of the Melbourne. There are a lot of factors
              that determine the price of a house including its location, size, number of rooms, etc.
              But people ignore many of these factors while buying or selling a house. That’s where
              this project comes in! It provides many factors for the house like it’s frontage, area,
              street, land contour, utilities, proximity, garage quality, roof materials, etc. with the
              ultimate aim of predicting the final price of the house based on these factors. You can
              get the Housing Prices Prediction Project dataset for on Kaggle and use it to create am
              ML algorithm that can accurately predict the house prices based on these factors.<br>
              DATASET reference : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anthonypino/melbournehousing-market
              <br>
              <br>
              Project 3 :<br>
              Project idea –Perform regression analysis to predict the profit of each the 50 startups mentioned in
              the dataset by taking all the input parameters(multi linear regression). The dataset
              consists of 5 columns where the ‘state’ column stores the categorical data points, and
              the rest are numerical features.
              Plot visuals by using Matplotlib/Seaborn data visualization comparing the different
              features of the input parameters and do Exploratory data analysis (EDA) by using
              pandas.<br>
